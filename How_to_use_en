 How to install a Chrome extension from a ZIP file
Important: The browser cannot read the .zip archive directly. You must extract it first.

1. Extract the archive:
Right-click the .zip file and select "Extract All" (or use a file archiver). You should now see a regular folder containing the extension files.

2. Open the Extensions page:
Launch Chrome.
In the address bar, type: chrome://extensions/ and press Enter.
(Alternatively, go through the menu: Three dots → Extensions → Manage extensions.)

3. Enable Developer mode:
In the top-right corner of the page, find the "Developer mode" toggle and turn it on.

4. Load the extension:
A button labeled "Load unpacked" will appear on the left. Click it.
In the file dialog that opens, select the folder you extracted in Step 1 (select the folder itself, not the files inside).

✅ Done!
The extension will appear in the list and start working immediately.

💡 Tip: Do not delete or move the extension folder on your computer after installation—otherwise, the extension will stop working in the browser.
